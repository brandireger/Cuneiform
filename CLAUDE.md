# CLAUDE.md — Hittite Fragment Matching Project

Standing context for all Claude Code sessions in this repository. Read
fully before acting. This file is the design authority; if a session's
work would contradict it, stop and flag the conflict instead of
improvising. The human collaborator (Ixca) makes final design calls.

## Project identity

Research project building a **content-based join and duplicate
suggester for fragmentary Hittite cuneiform texts**, using the openly
licensed TLHdig corpus. Two target outcomes, in order:

1. A working prototype + draft paper with real numbers, used as a
   demonstration artifact for a graduate mentorship pitch (UT Austin
   MSAI application in progress).
2. A submission to the Ancient Language Processing (ALP) workshop
   cycle (venue of Yavasan & Gordin 2025).

Tone of the work: rigorous, over-explicit, honest about negative
results. When in doubt, report more, claim less.

## Research question

Can modern representation learning substantially outperform classical
text classification at connecting fragmentary Hittite transliterations
to (a) their parent compositions and (b) their physical join partners
and duplicate witnesses — evaluated against known joins/duplicates at
full-corpus scale, with leakage-safe methodology?

## Corpus (pinned)

- **TLHdig Beta 0.2.0** — Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15459134,
  file `TLHdig_0.2.0-beta.zip` (63.9 MB,
  MD5 93e71e2560f5e109c87713d5590cb059). License **CC BY 4.0**.
  Cite as: Müller, Prechel, Rieken & Schwemer (2025).
- **21,868** real XML documents after excluding zip artifacts (320
  macOS `__MACOSX/` + AppleDouble `._*` junk entries — exclude these
  in every script that reads the zip); 384,667 `<lb>` line elements.
  229 documents (~1.0%) fail to parse (mismatched/invalid XML) — a
  real corpus data-quality issue, not a script bug; P2 must log and
  skip these, never silently drop without a record. Many documents
  are already multi-fragment rejoined texts (these encode our
  ground-truth joins).
- Multilingual layers present: Hittite, Akkadian, Sumerian, Hattic,
  Cuneiform Luwian, Palaic, Hurrian. Do not silently discard
  non-Hittite layers; they matter for parallels.
- Known caveat (per the TLHdig team): philological quality is uneven —
  it is a living community archive, not a critical edition. Quality
  filtering must be explicit and reported, never silent.
- **Actual schema is AOxml/HPM (hethiter.net Hethitologie Portal
  Mainz format), not the SimTex plaintext convention originally
  assumed here — verified via `01_inventory.py` (P1, run
  2026-07-20) against the real corpus. Key structure:**
  - `<lb txtid lnr lg cu>` = one transliterated line. `lnr` = line
    label (e.g. "Vs.? 1′"); `lg` = **per-line** language code (Hit,
    Akk, Hat, Hattian, ...) — the multilingual-layer signal lives
    here, at line granularity, not per-document; `cu` = raw
    cuneiform sign string. **Correction (P2, 02_parse.py damage-
    oracle check, 2026-07-20): `cu` is NOT an attested-only break
    silhouette — do not use it as one.** It renders the editor's
    complete PROPOSED reading, including restored (`<del_in>/
    <del_fin>`) content, as real glyphs; `▒` marks only positions
    where no sign value could be proposed at all (illegible `x`,
    indeterminate-length gaps). Verified: a fully-restored line (every
    sign inside a del-span) rendered with zero `▒`. The real per-sign
    attested/restored/laes/illegible_x state for the matrix model's
    edge profile comes from the transliteration markup itself
    (`sign_damage_states` in `corpus.parquet`, produced by a document-
    order state machine over `<del_in>/<del_fin>`/`<laes_in>/
    <laes_fin>`, since those spans cross word and line boundaries),
    not from `cu`. **`cu` is not cleanroom-safe (P2.5 A5 restatement):
    because it silently mixes in editor-restored content as real
    glyphs, never feed `cu` or any `cu`-derived feature to any
    evaluated model, at train time or test time** — it is a display/
    preview field, not a corpus signal.
  - `<w trans mrp0sel mrp1..mrp7>` = word. `trans` = transliterated
    form (the primary text signal); `mrp*` = ranked morphological
    parse candidates (lemma@gloss@paradigm@class) — rich, but this
    is glossing/analysis, **out of scope** per this file; do not
    build features off `mrp*` beyond incidental inspection.
  - **Break/restoration is NOT encoded as literal bracket
    characters** (raw bracket counts in body text are near-zero:
    12,339 `(` / 12,336 `)` from editorial notes, only 4 `[`, 0
    `]`/`⸢`/`⸣`). It's encoded structurally instead:
    `<del_in/>`/`<del_fin/>` = illegible/damaged span (often wraps a
    literal `x` placeholder sign); `<laes_in/>`/`<laes_fin/>` =
    partially-preserved/restored span; `<gap c="..." t="line">` =
    larger structural lacuna with a free-text description (e.g.
    "Rs. IV bricht ab"); `<space c="N"/>` = N sign-widths of blank
    run. **Reconstruct each fragment's edge profile from these tags
    plus `lb@cu`, not from bracket-character regex.**
  - `<sGr>`/`<aGr>`/`<d>` = Sumerogram / Akkadogram / determinative
    spans (matches the CAPS convention Yavasan & Gordin describe,
    but tag-delimited here rather than case-inferred).
    `<parsep>` = paragraph-ruling separator (real structural
    boundary). `<clb id nr>` = column line break / column number.
  - **CTH composition membership is structural, not textual**: one
    `CTH ###_XML` folder per composition in the zip (**662 distinct
    compositions**, 21,868/21,868 docs covered via folder path). Only
    530/21,868 docs additionally mention "CTH" as body/attribute
    text — do not use in-text regex for CTH labels; read the folder
    path.
  - **Join ground truth**: `docID` / `<AO:TxtPubl>` / `lb@txtid`
    carry the authoritative "+" join notation (e.g. docID
    `KBo 64.15+`, TxtPubl `"KBo 64.15 {€1} + KUB 7.38 {€2}"` — note
    the `{€N}` witness sigla, and per-line witness attribution
    inside composite `lnr` values like `"{€2+1} Vs. 1/Vs. I 1"`,
    which gives an **exact editor-supplied line-level alignment**
    between joined fragments — a strong supervision signal for the
    placement/offset scoring in the matrix model). 866 docs carry
    this authoritative join signal. **Do not** regex-scan all
    attributes/text for "+": `w@mrp*` fields use "+=" for clitic
    attachment (e.g. `"POSP += ma@CNJctr@@"`), which inflates a
    naive scan to 13,981 false-positive "join" docs.
  - `annot@editor` / `annot@date` = per-edit provenance metadata.
    Track for expert-agreement analysis; never use as a model
    feature (it identifies the editing process, not the text).
  - Yavasan & Gordin (ALP 2025, "From Clay to Code") worked from
    these same files — reuse their preprocessing decisions where
    sensible and cite them.
- Schema knowledge must come from `01_inventory.py` output
  (p1_out/, renamed from inventory_out/ 2026-07-21 for consistency
  with p2_out/p25_out/p3_out/p4_out), not assumptions. If inventory
  results and this file disagree, the inventory wins; update this
  file.

## Task definitions

- **Task A — Composition assignment.** Fragment → CTH composition,
  framed as retrieval (rank compositions). Modernizes Tyndall (2012),
  ACL P12-2048: his setup was 36 CTH texts, 389 fragments, MALLET
  Naive Bayes / MaxEnt, 10-fold CV, best accuracy **0.67** (MaxEnt,
  all tokens, restorations retained). Replicate approximately, then
  scale.
- **Task B — Pairwise matching.** Fragment → ranked corpus fragments,
  positives of two kinds: (i) physical join partners, (ii) duplicate /
  parallel witnesses of the same composition. **Always train pooled if
  sparsity demands, but ALWAYS evaluate and report joins-only,
  duplicates-only, and pooled — the full three-way matrix for every
  model.** This separation is a standing user decision.
- Metrics: recall@k (k=1,5,10,100), MRR; stratify by fragment length
  and by genre where CTH metadata allows.

### Bin reframe (P2.5 A1/A2, accepted 2026-07-21 — "let the artifacts
speak, not editors")

114 of 657 CTH numbers are fragment **catch-all bins**, not real
compositions (e.g. CTH 832 "Hethitische Fragmente verschiedenen
Inhaltes" — 3,583 unrelated fragments filed under one number for lack
of a better home; CTH 470 "Ritualfragmente"; CTH 670
"Festritualfragmente"). Identified via the real CTH catalogue title
(single bulk fetch from an archived hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/CTH/
snapshot — see `p25_out/bins_report.md`), not guessed from doc counts.
Consequence, binding on both tasks above:
- **Bin documents (14,046) are EXCLUDED from Task A labels, Task B
  duplicate-positive generation, contrastive negative sampling, and
  all reported metrics' truth sets.** A bin fragment may secretly
  belong to any composition, including a test-side one — it is
  unlabeled, not negative.
- Bin documents instead form the **discovery pool**
  (`p25_out/discovery_pool.parquet`) — inference-time queries only,
  never scored as ground truth. Model-proposed assignments of
  discovery-pool fragments to real compositions are a P7 deliverable
  for expert verification (see Cleanroom rule 5, "novel suggestions
  are quarantined").
- Impact was not cosmetic: naive same-CTH-folder duplicate-positive
  pairs = 13,451,014; bins-excluded (real compositions only) =
  234,263 — a 98.3% drop. Without this reframe, duplicate-witness
  supervision would have been almost entirely noise from catch-all
  bins, dominated by CTH 832 alone.
- **Physical joins are unaffected by bin status**: a composite join
  document whose parent CTH folder happens to be a bin still yields a
  valid join pair (the physical fit is real regardless of catalogue
  assignment) — tagged `parent_is_bin=True` in
  `p2_out/join_pairs.jsonl`, reported both included and excluded.
- 543 real compositions remain supervision-eligible. `main_split`
  (train/dev/test) is assigned over real compositions only; bin
  documents carry `main_split='discovery'`, never train/dev/test.

## The fragment-as-matrix model (core design requirement)

A fragment is a 2D grid: rows = lines, columns = sign positions. Four
edge types: left (line-beginnings lost), right (line-endings lost),
top (preceding lines lost), bottom (following lines lost). Bracket
conventions in the transliteration encode the break silhouette —
reconstruct each fragment's edge profile from text.

A candidate join is a 2D **placement**, scored in all directions:
forward/backward horizontally, and both vertical orientations. The
strongest signal is **multi-row consistency**: a true horizontal join
aligns coherently across several consecutive line-pairs at a
consistent offset. Aggregate placement scores over aligned row-pairs;
never rely on a single-edge continuation alone.

## Edge-continuation model ("layered neighbor")

One masked-span / MLM-style model over sign sequences serves three
roles: (1) restoration prediction pre-training, (2) layered
next-element prediction, (3) join scoring.

Granularity ladder (each is a reported intrinsic result, per genre):
- L0: next sign (classification over sign vocabulary)
- L1: next n signs (beam search, n≈2–5)
- L2: next word (respect SimTex word vs. hyphen/clitic boundaries)
- L3: next phrase/line

Join score = PMI-style lift of B's edge as continuation of A's edge
over corpus baseline (raw probability rewards formulaic openings —
don't use it), computed bidirectionally, both axes, aggregated over
the placement per the matrix model. The intrinsic table "how
predictable is Hittite at a fracture edge, per granularity, per
genre" is a standalone deliverable.

### Seam scoring must NEVER assume contiguity (P2.5 A6, design
commitment for P5 — no implementation yet)

Clay crumbles: even direct `+` joins lose signs at the fracture face,
and indirect `(+)` joins are same-tablet pairs separated by an
arbitrary lost span. Therefore:
- Horizontal seam score = plausibility of [A-edge] [unknown-length
  masked span] [B-edge], via span-infilling (T5-sentinel-style
  variable-length mask), never next-token adjacency.
- Vertical seam score = same, with the mask spanning an unknown
  number of whole lines (anchor to `gap t="line"` / "bricht ab"
  events where present).
- Multi-row consistency = alignment at a CONSISTENT but UNKNOWN
  offset across row-pairs, not exact abutment.
- Evaluation stratum: direct `+` pairs test near-contiguous seams;
  indirect `(+)` pairs (213 of 1,581 join-tier pairs, per
  `p25_out/join_tiers_report.md`) are the designated held-out test of
  long-gap tolerance. Report both, never pooled-only.

## Pipeline architecture

1. **Bi-encoder** (contrastive: same-composition witnesses pull
   together) → embed all fragments once, ANN retrieval of top-k.
2. **Edge-continuation scorer** reranks top-k for JOINS.
3. **Cross-encoder / verbatim-overlap scorer** reranks for DUPLICATES.
4. Score fragments at line/passage level and aggregate (max over
   line-pairs) as well as whole-fragment level; report both.

## Model ladder (run in this order; every rung reported)

1. BM25 / TF-IDF over sign n-grams — mandatory baseline; expected
   brutally strong on duplicates. If neural ≈ BM25, that is a finding,
   not a failure.
2. Naive Bayes / MaxEnt — Tyndall replication (original scale approx.
   and full scale).
3. ByT5 (small→base) — primary neural candidate (byte-level; T5
   lineage comparable to Yavasan & Gordin).
4. CANINE — alternate tokenization-free encoder.
5. From-scratch small transformer with a **sign-level tokenizer**
   (hyphen-separated signs as tokens; vocab ≈ few thousand) — the
   domain-native candidate; corpus is small enough to pre-train on
   one GPU.
6. XLM-R / mT5 — subword control, expected to lose; run it anyway.

Model selection on dev split only. All results, including losers, go
in the paper. Single consumer GPU is the compute budget; if a design
exceeds it, redesign.

## Cleanroom rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Test set purity.** Evaluation fragments are stripped to
   epigraphically attested signs only. Nothing restoration-derived,
   model-generated, or refined touches the test set. Test labels come
   from the corpus only.
2. **Split by composition.** All witnesses/fragments of a CTH
   composition land on the same side of every split. Joined fragments
   likewise. No composition-level leakage between train/dev/test.
3. **Restorations are distilled expert knowledge, not ground truth.**
   Scholars restored brackets partly USING duplicate knowledge —
   training signal yes, evaluation signal never. State this framing in
   all writeups.
4. **Self-training loop hygiene.** Pseudo-labels admitted only above a
   confidence threshold; max 2 rounds; full ablation (base vs round 1
   vs round 2). If gains are nil, report and cut.
5. **Novel suggestions are quarantined.** Model-proposed new joins /
   duplicates go in a separate "candidates for expert verification"
   list. They are NEVER counted as positives in any metric. This list
   is a headline deliverable (the mentorship pitch artifact).
6. **Restoration-agreement leakage ablation.** Quantify the
   performance delta of restorations-in vs attested-only — this is a
   contribution, not just hygiene.

## Evidence provenance and assistance controls (Phase 2 standing rule,
added 2026-07-22 per expert advisory input — see `EXPERT_OPINION.md`)

Read `EXPERT_OPINION.md` and `specs/EVIDENCE_POLICY.md` before
implementing any new content-consuming model or probe.

Every semantic input field must be registered with an evidence class.
Standard classes are: `OBSERVED_ARTIFACT`, `OBSERVED_DOCUMENT_STRUCTURE`,
`CATALOG_METADATA`, `EDITORIAL_TRANSCRIPTION`, `EDITORIAL_RESTORATION`,
`EDITORIAL_RELATION`, `MODEL_DERIVED`, and `SYSTEM_TECHNICAL`.

New code must fail closed when a requested field is unknown or
prohibited by the selected evidence policy. Editorial and model
assistance must be disable-able through configuration without changing
implementation code. Every new scoring/training run emits a
feature-use manifest recording requested and observed fields, evidence
classes, prohibited-field checks, hashes, seed, corpus version, git
commit, and declared statistics universe.

Do not call a result "artifact-only" merely because restorations were
removed. TLHdig transliteration is editorially mediated. Use the named
evidence-policy profile in reports (`artifact_strict`,
`transcription_assisted`, `catalog_assisted`, `scholar_assisted`, or
`discovery_assisted`) and state its permitted evidence classes.

Physical-join output must support abstention when the encoded evidence
is insufficient. Candidate output should preserve typed supporting
evidence, contradictory evidence, enabled assistance layers, and any
model-derived content; a single combined score is never the sole
persisted explanation.

Implementation: `lib/evidence_policy.py`, `configs/evidence_policies.yaml`,
`configs/evidence_registry.yaml`. This layer applies to NEW Phase 2
work; it was not retrofitted onto Phase 1's historical scripts or
reports in its first pass (a deliberate scope decision, not an
oversight — see `specs/EVIDENCE_POLICY.md`'s "Scope control").

## Provenance & generalization

Filename/ID prefixes → site (verify against inventory; refine with
expert input): KBo/KUB/Bo/VBoT/IBoT/ABoT = Hattusa; HKM/Mşt =
Maşat/Tapikka; Or. = Ortaköy/Sapinuwa; KuT/KuSa = Kuşaklı/Šarišša;
KpT = Kayalıpınar/Šamuha; RS = Ugarit; Msk = Emar; AT = Alalakh.
Headline generalization experiment: **train on Hattusa, test on
provincial fragments** (simulates deployment on newly excavated
material — the Sapinuwa scenario Tyndall himself named in 2012).
Provincial + multilingual material also supplies hard negatives.

## Engineering standards

- Deterministic seeds everywhere; log seed, git commit, dataset
  version (0.2.0-beta) in every results file.
- Corpus statistics (BM25 IDF/avgdl, calibration distributions,
  vocabulary counts, damage-rate profiles) are fit over the DECLARED
  universe for their phase (typically the full non-test universe),
  never over query-derived subsets. Any deviation is a documented
  decision, not a default. (Added 2026-07-22 after the E1.3
  reconciliation; see p5c_report.md.)
- Model-input encoding goes through
  `hittite_tokenizer.encode_fragment_window()`; local
  re-implementations are forbidden. (Added 2026-07-22 after the E2
  content-blind seam-scoring bug — a per-script reimplementation of
  this exact step silently fed `<UNK>`-only input to the frozen D14
  head for an entire phase; see p5c_report.md / p5c2_report.md.)
- Corpus build = governed dataset with lineage: every transform
  scripted, no hand edits; derived datasets carry provenance metadata.
- Stdlib-or-common-deps preference; pin versions in
  requirements.txt; everything runs on the local laptop.
- Small artifacts (reports, metrics JSON, failure samples) are the
  unit of exchange with the browser-Claude architect sessions; never
  ship the raw corpus or weights back and forth.
- Outputs of every phase: a runnable script + a small human-readable
  report.
- **File layout (reorganized 2026-07-21, once D14/D15 finished running):**
  numbered pipeline scripts live in `scripts/`, reusable modules in
  `lib/`, active configs in `configs/`, the parallel demo track in
  `demo/`. Earlier phase-sequence bullets below reference bare script
  names (e.g. "`01_inventory.py`") from before this reorg — read those
  as `scripts/01_inventory.py` etc. Always invoke from the project
  root (`python scripts/19_pretrain.py ...`), never after `cd scripts`
  — data paths are CWD-relative, only `lib/` imports are resolved
  relative to the script file itself. See `README.md`'s "Where things
  are" for the full map.

## Phase sequence

- **P1 Inventory** (`01_inventory.py`) — schema census; where CTH,
  joins (`+` notation), provenance, brackets actually live. GATES ALL
  LATER DESIGN.
- **P2 Parser + dataset builder** — leakage-safe splits per cleanroom
  rules; three-way label structure (join / duplicate / negative).
  **DONE (2026-07-20)**, per `specs/P2_PARSER_SPEC.md`. All 5 acceptance
  checks passed. Superseded/amended by P2.5 below — see
  `p2_out/dataset_report.md` for the original P2-only numbers.
- **P2.5 Amendments** — **DONE, ACCEPTED, FROZEN (2026-07-21)**, per
  `specs/P2.5_AMENDMENTS.md`. Scripts `07_metadata_patch.py` → `08_bins.py`
  → `09_join_tiers.py` → `10_resplit.py`, outputs in `p25_out/` (plus
  amended files in `p2_out/`). All 6 acceptance checks passed. Key
  numbers (supersede the P2 block above): 543 real compositions /
  14,046 bin (discovery-pool) documents, bin reframe above; duplicate
  pairs naive 13,451,014 → bins-excluded 234,263; join pairs 1,581,
  now tiered (478 A / 185 B / 918 C, 431 tier-C testable after the
  exclusive-content degenerate guard) — see `p25_out/join_tiers_report.md`;
  **`main_split` FROZEN 2026-07-21, no further re-rolls**: train 6,073
  / dev 760 / test 760 docs (80.0/10.0/10.0 by documents, greedy
  doc-count-balanced re-roll — see `p2_out/split_report.md`), bin docs
  carry `main_split='discovery'`; `site_split` provincial-eval grew
  201 → 314 docs after the verified DAAM/Kp provenance patch (DAAM is
  a multi-site series — see `p25_out/provenance_patch.md`); repo
  git-initialized, commit hash logged in `p2_out/splits.json`. Full
  detail in `p25_out/p25_report.md`.
- **P3 Baselines** — BM25, Tyndall replication. First real numbers.
  MUST consume `p2_out/splits.parquet`'s frozen `main_split` /
  `site_split` columns and respect the bin reframe (discovery-pool
  docs excluded from all supervision and metrics).
- **P4 Sign tokenizer + masked-span pre-training.**
- **P5 Bi-encoder + edge-continuation scorer + rerankers.**
- **P6 Evaluation matrix + ablations** (restorations, pre-training,
  cross-site, self-training rounds, fragment length, genre).
- **P7 Candidate list for expert verification + draft paper.**

## Out of scope (do not drift)

Morphological glossing; machine translation; sign-image/photo models;
3D break geometry (the CuKa / "3D-Joins und Schriftmetrologie"
projects at Würzburg/Mainz own that modality — our lane is textual
content); decipherment framing of any kind (Hittite is deciphered);
minting new ground-truth labels from model output.

## Open questions — P1 answers (2026-07-20)

1. **What does the XML encode for joins, line structure, bracket
   positions, CTH linkage?** Answered — see the schema bullets under
   "Corpus (pinned)" above: joins via `docID`/`TxtPubl`/`lb@txtid` +
   `{€N}` witness sigla, line structure via `<lb>` (`lnr`/`lg`/`cu`),
   breaks via `<del_in/fin>`/`<laes_in/fin>`/`<gap>`/`<space>` (not
   bracket characters), CTH via folder path (`CTH ###_XML`).
2. **How many join-positive pairs exist?** 866 documents carry
   authoritative join notation (docID/TxtPubl/txtid), out of 21,868.
   That's a real but small positive set at the *document* level —
   P2 needs to actually parse the `{€N}` witness lists and per-line
   `lnr` attributions into pairwise edges (a doc with 3+ witnesses
   yields multiple join pairs) before we know the true pair count.
   Until that count is in hand, plan for **pooled training**
   (joins + duplicates) with separate joins-only/duplicates-only/
   pooled evaluation, per the standing three-way-matrix decision —
   treat joins-only training as likely infeasible until P2 says
   otherwise.
3. **How much provincial-site material is present per site?**
   Answered, and it's sparse: of 21,868 docs, Hattusa-prefixed
   (KBo/KUB/IBoT/ABoT/Bo/VBoT/HT) = 19,370 (~89%); provincial total
   is only ~194 (HKM/Maşat 110, Or/Sapinuwa 34, KuSa+KuT/Kuşaklı 42,
   Msk/Emar 7, RS/Ugarit 7, AT/Alalakh 1); 2,297 docs have no
   recognized prefix (need a widened prefix table or manual check —
   likely additional sigla not yet in `SITE_PREFIXES`). **The
   headline Hattusa→provincial generalization experiment will have a
   test set of at most a few hundred fragments** — flag this
   explicitly as a small-sample limitation in the paper, per "report
   more, claim less."
4. **Does the corpus record duplicate-witness relations explicitly,
   or must duplicates be derived via shared CTH membership?**
   Not yet answered by P1 — no explicit "duplicate of X" field was
   observed in the sampled documents; the working assumption is
   duplicates must be *derived* from shared `CTH ###_XML` folder
   membership (multiple docIDs under one composition = candidate
   duplicate/parallel witnesses), which then needs philological
   sanity-checking (same composition ≠ automatically a usable
   duplicate pair — e.g. distant fragments of a very long text may
   share no actual overlapping content). Confirm/refute in P2 by
   checking whether any element beyond `AO:Manuscripts` cross-
   references sibling docIDs.
